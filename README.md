What did I do?
Automatic Table and Date Search
Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code using JavaScript with D3.js to append a table to a HTML web page and then add new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Use a date form in the HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

Multiple Search Categories
Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

date/time
city
state
country
shape
